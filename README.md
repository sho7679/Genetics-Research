Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are the most common craniofacial defects, having an overall incidence of 1/1000 live births. They are classified into three categories: Cleft lip only (cl), cleft palate with cleft lip (CP), and isolated Cleft palate. Nonsyndromic OFCs are phenotypically and etiologically heterogenous: since CL occurs at a different time point in development, it may have a different etiology from the other subtypes. There has not been much research on risk factors for this specific subtype, so we looked at the contribution of rare, coding de novo mutations (DNMs), which are mutations that spontaneously arise during embryonic development. 

We used data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program to obtain case-parent trios with CL-only. After whole genome sequencing of 80 European trios and generating a high confidence list of DNMs, we were left with 89 DNMs to conduct various analyses.
